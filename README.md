Hi there,

I'm Simon, currently building [Shelv](https://shelv.app): Hackable, Local, AI-enabled notes. It is source available [here](https://github.com/twop/shelv). 

My CV is [here](https://github.com/twop/twop/blob/main/resume/cv.pdf)

## About me
I have been fascinated with software since I was a kid, as it usually happens, it started with a game: Baldur's Gate. But what happens less frequently is I became a game developer and worked on two big titles for 7 years.

That affected me in several ways:
- At that time, you needed to build everything from scratch (this was before Unity), hence it was just normal to build a brand new physics engine or UI framework or network stack based on UDP => there are no impossible tasks, just hard ones.
- Performance is arguably the second most important thing in games (after gameplay) => I built a passion and appreciation for squeezing CPU and GPU cycles.
- I really enjoyed working on dev tools, virtual machines, and languages. Long story, but we slapped a VM into the game engine to run Flash on the GPU (I believe we were the first to run it on the GPU).
- 7 years of C++ leave scars on your soul.

Since then, I've worked in many different domains and different tech stacks, but performance and tools always called to me. The past 6 years I spent at various early-stage startups, none of which worked out well for me, so there is that. 

###  Some cool (at least for me) work I did in my past free time:
- Implemented the JavaScript promise spec in an interpreter written in C# https://github.com/sebastienros/jint
- Co-started an optimizing JS compiler for Elm output https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-optimize-level-2
- Implemented a pull-based virtual DOM reconciler in F# for a mobile UI framework with primarily stack allocations https://github.com/fabulous-dev/Fabulous


### Tools I'm using
- DIY 34 keys split keyboard -> [Forager](https://github.com/carrefinho/forager) and my [travel case](https://github.com/twop/forager-travel-case)
- Editor -> [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)
- Terminal -> [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) with [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/), I even wrote a plugin!
- MacOS stuff:
	* Launchers: [Leaderkey](https://github.com/mikker/LeaderKey.app) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
	* Keyboard navigation: [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/) and [mouseless](https://mouseless.click/)
